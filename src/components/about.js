            <p>I enjoy building applications from scratch, taking apart existing applications to see how they work, as well as learning new languages and frameworks.</p>
            <p>When I'm not developing a new app, I stay busy with a variety of challenging activities like playing lacrosse for McGill's varsity team, designing sustainable tiny-homes, or digitaly mixing music.</p>
